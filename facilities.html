          Laser Cutter Inductions
        </h2>
        <p>
          The computer that sits besides the laser cutter should be used only
          to operate the laser cutter. Members are discouraged from making designs
          on the computer as it might disrupt the laser cutter's availability.
          To make your designs, you can download CAD software on your own laptops.
        </p>
        <p>
          To use the laser cutter in the robotics lab, you have to attend
          one of our induction sessions. Only after attending these sessions will
          you have access to the software that controls the laser cutter.
          <em>(The exact time and date of laser cutter induction sessions will be
          available when the term begins!)</em>
